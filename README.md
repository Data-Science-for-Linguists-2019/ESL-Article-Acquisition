# ESL-Article-Acquisition

This is Elena's term project. An analysis on how non-native English speakers acquire articles.

## Project Info
Title: English as a Second Language (ESL) Article Acquisition

By: Elena Cimino (e.cimino@pitt.edu)

Date: 2019.04.26

## Brief Project Summary

English article acquisition is notoriously difficult for non-native English learners. The four articles in English (definite _the_, indefinite _a_ and _an_, and zero article _âˆ…_) map to approximately 90 different functions (Zhao & MacWhinney, 2018). It's no wonder that articles can be hard to acquire!

This project investigates the acquisition of English articles by learners of three different first languages: Spanish ([+art] language with definite, indefinite, and zero articles), Korean ([-art] language, meaning it lacks any overt article system), and Arabic ([+art] language with definite and zero articles but no indefinite article).

The corpora used for this project are the [BuiD Arabic Learner Corpus](http://www.buid.ac.ae/balc) and the [Pitt ELI Corpus](https://github.com/ELI-Data-Mining-Group/Pitt-ELI-Corpus).
