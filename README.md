# ESL-Article-Acquisition
This is Elena's term project. An analysis on how non-native English speakers acquire articles.

The corpora used for analysis will the the [BuiD Arabic Learner Corpus](buid.ac.ae/balc) and the [Pitt ELI Corpus](https://github.com/ELI-Data-Mining-Group/Pitt-ELI-Corpus). Analyses will be done on selected count and non-count (mass) nouns, and whether appropriate articles were used. Accuracy and errors in (written) production of articles are of particular interest.
