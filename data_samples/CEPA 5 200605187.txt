The last weekend I went with my family to Al-Hafeet Mountain in AL Ain. After we arrived there we had decided to eat the lunch. But there was no spoons and no glasses or any thing can help us to eat the lunch that my mother had made it at the home, so my couisn went to bring plastic spoons and glasses from a very far grocery. When he returned we were very hungry that we thought we will eat a plenty of my mother cooked, but my mother rembered that she forgote to put salt in the rice. But we decided to eat the horrid rice because of our hunger. After the sunrise the wether started to become cold and I felt that I will freezes in anytime, so my father decide to return home when he saw my miserable matter. The next day I become very sick and I spend all the weekend sleeping on my bed.
