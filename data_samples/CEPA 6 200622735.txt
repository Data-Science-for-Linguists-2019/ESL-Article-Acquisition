-On scorchings, warm, summer holiday my friend and I decided to go on a holiday to London, for there it would be much cooler and we would enjoy our summer in the numerous facilities we could do, plus I was so excited to see my other friend who
studies there, I havn`t seen him since highs school was over.
-So My Friend Ali and I went and bought the boarding tickets, the flight was at one o`clock Am. We packed our bags at 12 o`clock and headed for the Air port, which wasn`t that far away.
-Seven hours in the plain, we were exhusted from the flight, I hated the meals they offered but the t.v movies where great, time passed so rapidly.
-Finally the United Kingdom air port was right befor us we entered and our Friend Hur who studied in London took us to his place.
-In the next we went for a tour it was so amazing, we saw the Big Ben, we visited many historical regons and we even had a great time on a tour boat, the air was cool and fresh it was
We met many nice people , the resturants where great, the shopping malls had all our wants I was puzzled about what to buy for my family and friends.However the atimosphere and the greenery was so refleshing it was I spectacular day I`ll always cherish.
