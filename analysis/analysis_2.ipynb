       "\"\\nParents play the most important role in the growing up of their children. In my opion, despite some very good characteristics parents have, they can't be the best teachers of their children.\\n\\nFirst of all, parents are able to have knowledge in some fields, but not all the fields. It is not true that parents know everything in the world. Sometimes, they just have a passing acquaintance of some subjects. They shouldn't teach their children something that they don't know thoroughly. For example, a very famous physicist can't teach his children chemistry though he is very good at physics because his knowledge of chemistry isn't enough to teach his children. So that's why parents always search for good teachers to teach their children what they need to learn rightly.\\n\\nSecondly, parents want to teach their children by their ways. They are right, and they are wrong sometimes. For those who aren't be educated how to be good teachers, it might be a very big problem. They can be good parents, but hardly good teachers. For instance, it's not simply to tell children what they should do and what they shouldn't. If the children don't follow, their parents might get angry. In that case, they lose their control, and they just want their children to obey them without any decent explanation for their behavior. Parents should help their children be aware of the wrong and the right in order that they will know why their parents want them to follow their advice.\\n\\nThirdly, parents are easy to be wrong in educating their children in that they have much emotion. Under their eyes, their children are obviously the best ones. They praise their children and encourage them to keep doing things though under other eyes, the children should stop behaving like that. Consequently, parents should be strict and thoughtful in some situation. As children don't acknowlege which is right and wrong, they do anything they like. Parents should always watch on their children and guide them to do the right instead of letting them do whatever they want.\\n\\nfinally, parents aren't always good teachers though they might be good parents. To be good teachers, it is the way they educate their children which they should be concerned with rather than the way they love their children.\\n\\nactually with some  help \""

I asked him how I could take his exam if I did not learn any thing in his class. After that, he appeared very nervous. I do not know why. Next, I went to his office, and he began to curse at me.

    "I have a lovely sister who works at a bank in Korea. She is two years younger than me, but she is as tall as me. Of course, she is lighter than I am in weight. Then, she looks younger than her real age; I think it is because of the history of our family. Actually, all of my family members, including me, have young faces. Next, she has splendid, long black hair. Also, she often likes to change her hair style. So, she sometimes has big wavy long hair, or sometimes she has straight long hair. In addition, she has big eyes and double-edged eyelids, unlike me. Moreover, she has bright skin color and a good smile. Therefore, people who have ever seen her think that she is feminine and benevolent.\n",
    "However, I know that she is not as affectionate as her appearance. First of all, she is selfish and doesn't take a conciliatory attitude to me. Especially, she yields an inch on that food, so we sometimes squabble. Once, someone came to my home with Haagen Dazs Vanila ice cream, and we put it in our refrigerator. At that time, I had no time to eat it because I had to go out to finish something. I was only thinking of the ice cream while I went out. However, I didn't eat it because my sister ate it all. I was really angry and asked for her about it. Then, she said, \"Why didn't you eat it before I eat it?\". On the contrary, she sometimes makes me laugh because she mishears what I say. Once, I asked her, \"Do you try the cheese snack?\", but she misheard me. She heard \"employment\" instead of \"cheese snack\", \"employment\" is pronounced as 'chui jik' in Korean. Also, Such things are a daily event. Finally, I wish she would conduct in her appearance. Then, I think that she can be more lovely woman than what she is. "
