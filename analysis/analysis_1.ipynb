    "I get to data analysis in this notebook. This is _part 1_, as I am planning on attacking analysis from another aspect in the future. This notebook looks at the usage of articles in front of specific count and mass nouns, obtained from the prepatory analysis and exploration. However, due to limitations on finding nouns used in each level of interest for four language groups in two different corpora (Arabic L1 from BALC, Arabic L1 from PELIC, Spanish L1 from PELIC, Korean L1 from PELIC), only 1 sample from each level in each language was able to be obtained. Due to this, and due to the fact that I may not have very many interesting or informative findings, I am planning on expanding my analysis in a second part.\n",

On the other hand, I am having a teacher this semester who is always fighting with us in a good way, with the goal of encourage us to study hard every day. We have been practicing different kind of essay using god topics to keep our attention in class.

With this teacher we had a system of work very strict, which consisted in listen to the theory, and then we did the practice. On the other hand, my current teacher has a style of teaching very interesting, which consist in different activities during the class. We have played games to figure out vocabulary words, also we have played games in team to practice different strategies of English.  \n",

The story is about how important first impressions are and how they effect the way aperson is seen. This happened when Elizabeth bennet overhears Mr.Darsey , Arich gentleman complaing to his friend about the party they were attending and how he thought that Elizabeth was not pretty and called her plain. After that Elizabeth thinks of Mr. Darsey as an arrogant man and doesn't want anything to do with him, She also refuses his marrige proposal because of her pride, And it takes many incedents and some time before she realises that she had fallen in love with him and the film ends with her accepting his proposal..

      "Earthquakes are natural phenomena that have been causing disasters in many countries where impact them. In recent years, Asian countries have been most affected; they are more prone to earthquakes for various reasons geological and volcanic eruptions. The impact of earthquakes can affect mainly on: the death of people, destruction of entire cities and the economy's down, causing negative effects on the future of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "The death of people is the most terrible effect that earthquakes can cause. They occurred in seconds and people don't have chance to prepare for defense against it. When persons death, affect directly the feelings and emotions of them, making a terrible situation in the population. Furthermore, people still live in the city affected, try to rescue their families, friends, and neighbors, also eventually died.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earthquakes affect directly in the destruction of entire cities. They are strong and destroy most of all the infrastructure of the cities. In some cases, it can destroy buildings, hospitals, houses, universities, buses, cars, streets, and highways, affecting all material things possible. All of these natural disasters make very difficult the rescue of persons. Help usually is required of other cities, even other countries, as soon as possible, some helps send helicopters, ambulances, food or everything that is helpful. \n",
      "\n",
      "After that earthquakes happen in the cities, only awaiting a desert city, where you will find everything totally destroyed and over. Many people die, infrastructure has been damaged, the shops are closed, schools and universities there are no classes, businesses are stops, all this results in that the economy down. These natural disasters affect the economy severely, because cities must recover and rebuild everything to function normally.\n",

      "In conclusion, earthquakes are natural disasters that have affected many countries in the world. They occur with different intensity and damage, some strongly and others without causing damage. These natural disasters occur without anyone expected, but in my opinion, people should try to have expectations at home to be prepared for any natural disaster.\n",

These features are related to the different types of responsabilities, friends, education, children, properties, stability, travel, time, space, clothes, freedom, etc. There are many comparasion and contrasts between single people and married people.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the responsabilities of the married people are very different from single people. Maried people must work to support their children, for paying all the checks, for buying food, for paying all the needs of their children such as education, healthy insuarance, recreation, clothes, vaccins, etc. Generally, the single people don't have children and it makes easier the life of the single people. Basically, they have to dedicate to study in the majority of the cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the friends of the married people are more affected than the single people due to all couples should share their life, they should share the majority of the activities since they are an unit. Commonly, married people are busier than single people. Then, the married people spend less time with their friends than the single people. Nevetherless, both married people and single people can have the same amount of friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, traveling is not easy for the married people because of their duties. The overheads of the matrimony are higher than the expenses of the single people. Nonetheless, there are many families that plan to travel at least once per year. On the other hand, there are many single people that cannot travel frequently or scarcely they travel close to the cities or town. In addition, married people have more properties than single people due to .they find the stability of the their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, there are many differences in the life of both single people and maried people. Perhaps, the married people have more limitations than the single people because of enourmous responsabilities, However, the married people have more stability than the single people. According to this analysis, both married and single people have cons and pros. Simply, the married's life is a stage very different from single's life.\n",
