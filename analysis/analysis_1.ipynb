    "I get to data analysis in this notebook. This is _part 1_, as I am planning on attacking analysis from another aspect in the future. This notebook looks at the usage of articles in front of specific count and mass nouns, obtained from the prepatory analysis and exploration. However, due to limitations on finding nouns used in each level of interest for four language groups in two different corpora (Arabic L1 from BALC, Arabic L1 from PELIC, Spanish L1 from PELIC, Korean L1 from PELIC), only 1 sample from each level in each language was able to be obtained. Due to this, and due to the fact that I may not have very many interesting or informative findings, I am planning on expanding my analysis in a second part.\n",

      "Nowadays many people learn and study English in many countries. English is the most expanse language in the world. More than half the populations around the world speak English. I have chosen English as the second language after my mother tongue. Learning another language gives me the ability to understand other culture.  Also there are three main reasons why I decided to learn English as a second language, study, communication, and business.\n",
      "The most important reason is study. Learning English is usually a part of getting a high score on a test such as TOEFL for university. I have to study English hard to enter a good university in the U.S. Also, there are so many books written in English that I must learn English. The English is the language of sciences now. There are many researches and conferences had used English language. The English is the key to many things. For example books, music, computers, health, and internet.\n",
      "The next reason is communication. English has become the international language over the world. I learn English because I want to travel to another country and I need to know speak English to get many things as stay in a hotel or buy gifts or communicate with other people. Also English is the main language of organizations like the Unite Nation. There are lots of letters and postcards are written in English. Almost all international competitions are administrated in English. For example, the Olympics worlds contest. In addition I talk about my ideas and opinions on internet discussion groups or send e-mail to interesting people and learn about their life and culture.\n",
      "The last reason is business. Learning English give me the ability do business oversees in other countries. Learning English helps me to open the door of business and markets over the world. All business today is international. I have to know English to contact other businesspeople. There are many international business newspapers and magazines written in English. \n",
      "  In conclusion, learning English is probably one of the best skills to study by the beat language and communication with people from different country and make business over the world. Learning other countries language is very hard, but there are lots of people learning English. And each of them has a variety of important reasons.\n",

      "        A lot of people really get wonderful opportunities in their life only because they are beautiful or handsome. On the other hand there are some people who didn't get such chances because they don't look good although they are qualified. There are some positives effects of being beautiful or handsome such as getting a better job or having a great social life. However; there are some negatives like facing sexual harassment. \n",
      "        Everybody feels comfortable or happy when seeing a good looking person especially from the opposite sex. There are some positives of being a good-looking person. First of all, handsome or beautiful people get good chances in their life. For example, if two women applied for a job and they were both qualified for it, the company would most likely hire the prettier one because people judge from the appearance.  Secondly, the social life of a good looking person is usually better because people want to know this person to date him/her for example.  According to Jane Brody (1981) attractiveness was an important factor in choosing a partner to date.\n",
      "        \n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some negatives of being beautiful or handsome. One of the negatives for example is a company could hire unqualified people for important position because they are attractive. The company may not know that this specific person is not qualified but they judged the book by its cover. In the same article, Jane wrote \"M INNEAPOLIS STUDIES of physical attractiveness show that people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover, often with dramatic effects on those being judged\". Another negative of being a good looking person is that beautiful people could face sexual harassment in their life especially at an early age and this could destroy the person's life. A big number of people who have Psychological Issues, have suffered from sexual harassment when they were young.\n",
      "        In conclusion, being a good-looking person has some positives like better chances in life and a good social life. However it has also some negatives such as facing sexual harassment.\n",

      "Learning English has been very hard to understand for me, but I have had many teachers that have encouraged me to practice English all the time to improve my skills. Every teacher has its own style of teaching class, but it is crucial that at the end all teachers have the same goal, try to give to students the best information possible. Each style of teaching has positive and negative aspects; in this essay I will focus in two of my teachers, and specifically in how they were alike, and how they were different each other. \n",

I enjoyed her style of teaching because was very useful, in areas such as listening activities in class, or learning new vocabulary words. On the other hand, I am having a teacher this semester who is always fighting with us in a good way, with the goal of encourage us to study hard every day. We have been practicing different kind of essay using god topics to keep our attention in class. We have tried to work very fast in the semester to cover as much as possible with respect of the lessons in the book. We have studied new vocabulary words, different form of words, and different kind of essay.\n",

My teacher of last semester had a style of class very serious, where she explained all her class and students keep sitting, and listen to her carefully. With this teacher we had a system of work very strict, which consisted in listen to the theory, and then we did the practice. On the other hand, my current teacher has a style of teaching very interesting, which consist in different activities during the class. We have played games to figure out vocabulary words, also we have played games in team to practice different strategies of English.  \n",

The film that I enjoyed the most was based on and named after the classic novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" It stars Keira Knightley who's one of my favourite actresses. The story is about how important first impressions are and how they effect the way aperson is seen. This happened when Elizabeth bennet overhears Mr.Darsey , Arich gentleman complaing to his friend about the party they were attending and how he thought that Elizabeth was not pretty and called her plain. After that Elizabeth thinks of Mr. Darsey as an arrogant man and doesn't want anything to do with him, She also refuses his marrige proposal because of her pride, And it takes many incedents and some time before she realises that she had fallen in love with him and the film ends with her accepting his proposal.. I enjoyed this film because of the great story, the wonderful scenery and because it can be seen in the real world , last but not least I learnt that we shouldn't judde a book by it's cover .\n",

Next, she has splendid, long black hair. Also, she often likes to change her hair style. So, she sometimes has big wavy long hair, or sometimes she has straight long hair.

At that time, I had no time to eat it because I had to go out to finish something. I was only thinking of the ice cream while I went out. However, I didn't eat it because my sister ate it all. I was really angry and asked for her about it. Then, she said, \"Why didn't you eat it before I eat it?\". On the contrary, she sometimes makes me laugh because she mishears what I say. Once, I asked her, \"Do you try the cheese snack?\", but she misheard me. She heard \"employment\" instead of \"cheese snack\", \"employment\" is pronounced as 'chui jik' in Korean.

These are his problems he didn't do much advertising and offered bad quality foods to customer due to not enough money.  Also, the foods' price is expensive to students.  He should be guaranteed finance to solve the problems.  If he cooperates with others, Higgins and his business partners have to distribute a profit. However, the business partners can solve his financial problem.  If he has enough finance, he should hire a professional chief because the most important thing is tastes in a restaurant.   Also, he should drop the foods' price.  This is because his restaurant is located at Benson University so his main customers are students in the university.  The lower prices and good tastes are very important to students in their lunch time. Then, many students will prefer to go Higgins' restaurant in their lunch time due to the lower price and good quality foods.  Therefore, he will be great success in his business with his partners without advertising. \n",

      "Many young people desire to get marry  quickly and other married people want to return to their past life. There are many features between single people and married people. These features are related to the different types of responsabilities, friends, education, children, properties, stability, travel, time, space, clothes, freedom, etc. There are many comparasion and contrasts between single people and married people.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the responsabilities of the married people are very different from single people. Maried people must work to support their children, for paying all the checks, for buying food, for paying all the needs of their children such as education, healthy insuarance, recreation, clothes, vaccins, etc. Generally, the single people don't have children and it makes easier the life of the single people. Basically, they have to dedicate to study in the majority of the cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the friends of the married people are more affected than the single people due to all couples should share their life, they should share the majority of the activities since they are an unit. Commonly, married people are busier than single people. Then, the married people spend less time with their friends than the single people. Nevetherless, both married people and single people can have the same amount of friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, traveling is not easy for the married people because of their duties. The overheads of the matrimony are higher than the expenses of the single people. Nonetheless, there are many families that plan to travel at least once per year. On the other hand, there are many single people that cannot travel frequently or scarcely they travel close to the cities or town. In addition, married people have more properties than single people due to .they find the stability of the their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, there are many differences in the life of both single people and maried people. Perhaps, the married people have more limitations than the single people because of enourmous responsabilities, However, the married people have more stability than the single people. According to this analysis, both married and single people have cons and pros. Simply, the married's life is a stage very different from single's life.\n",
