    "        - Some files use \"↑\" whereas others use HTML codes `<o> ... </o>`, `<i> ... </i>`, and `<x> ... </x>`\n",
    "        - The tagging of correction codes is not uniform, e.g.: `fr<o om > </o>` vs `thi<o> s</o>`, where the first example has the `<o>` tag _including_ the part of the word it is tagging, and the second which does not\n",
    "        - The spacing of tagging varies, such as: \n",
    "            - `<x>and they are bad layer on the com</x>`, where the cross-out tagging is flush to the words\n",
    "            - `or<x> e </x>`, where `e` is the thing crossed out but the tags actually start connecting to the previous word and end after the thing being crossed out\n",
    "            - `and  <x> goo </x> very` where the tagging is just removed from each side of the thing being crossed out by a space \n",
    "            - `<o> s</o> ociety` where one letter of a word is being emphasized, but the letter _is not_ connected to the word it is a part of\n",
    "            - `<o> A</o>lso` where the letter emphasized _is_ connected to the word it belongs to\n",
    "            - `c<o> are</o>` where the tag of the letters begins connected to the word, where a subpart is being emphasized, but the actual part of the word being emphasized is not connected\n",
    "            - `orp<o> han</o>  s`, which separates the word \"orphans\"\n",
    "            - `m<o>y</o>` where everything is flush\n",

    "    - A \"Normalized\" Essay column, that has a more (or completely) uniform tagging system \n",

It was really great and nice place, but I didn`t enjoyed it because no girls were with me . I asked my cousin to come with us but she refused that because she joined a sports club .There was alot of st_r_ange animals. My brother was taking photoes for the animals and I was too board. I was walking like a sick person. I hated my self and prayed to go back to our country to see my sister. I missed her so much. After few day we came back home then I became the happiest person in the world.'"

There are many things you can enjoy in summer holiday like travel, make a long time for a fun, reading many books to save information. In the last summer I enjoy traveled with my family to Australia, Malaysia and Thailand. In Australia I enjoy traveled to Sydeny and Gold Coust. Sydeny is th_b_big city and the best city in the Australia. There are many place we enjoyed like zoo, musum and shopping centers. However, Gold Coust is the fun city that we enjoyed many big parks like sea worlds and Dream worlds. In addition the weathe was very cold and windy that we shold were a jus_t_and take umbrala. Also, we visited Maloysia. Malaysia is a very wonderful country. They are many trees, rivers and green mountain. There are a lot of rainning and the warm weather. However there are many place to fun and shop. And I shold taken an umbrella all the time. The third place us visited are bangkok the city of Thailand that many Arabs toursts visit this countly for shopping. There are very wonderful things in Thailand and very big zoo like \"safary park\". Also, the weathe in Thailand was very hot with a lot of rain. Finally, I enjoyed my summer holiday too much happy an fun with my familly. And I hope that travel to other countrise will learn me many thinks and communication with many people from diffrend country and learn many That makes me happy.'"

More serious results are XXX gum infection and damage to bones and tissues underteeth However the most terrible results are fatal diseases such as cancer and heart diseases Inspit of their awareness of the dangers of smoking smokers donot quit for many reasons firstly they are not always of the dangers to their healthy unfortunately they often are safe from dangerous diseases. Scondly it is easier to start smoking than it is to quit. It taskes a long time to stop this bad habit thirdly smokers becomesalves to the habit and are too weak to quit. Fourthly medicines that can help smokers to quit are expensive.
